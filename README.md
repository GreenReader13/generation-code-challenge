Generation Take-Home Coding Challenge
=================================
This is a take-home coding challenge used to help evaluate candidates
interested in joining the team at Generation.
The goal is for candidates to complete the coding challenge before the
phone or in-person interview (if invited) so that we can discuss the solution together.


### What should you expect?

We expect that the exercise will take 3-5 hours to complete,
depending on your familiarity with React and with the GoogleMaps API.
Most of our candidates take 5-7 days to send us their solution.

We understand that this is a significant amount of time so we really appreciate
the effort you put into it.

### How should you submit your code?

Please send us an email with a link to your personal repo, or a link with the application running on a server. 
Please include a couple screenshots of the app.

### What if I don't know React? 

Feel free to submit a solution that meets the requirements, but without using React.
React is an important part of our stack and you'll be using it every day so it's important
that you're excited to learn it! If you don't know React and you're able to learn the basics
in order to complete the exercise, we'll be impressed :)

### How do you start?

Clone the repo on your computer

Run
```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
Read the intro and next steps on localhost:3000
Edit `src/YourComponent.js`.  
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser.

### What do we look for?

* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked (e.g., all the user stories are complete)? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **UX**:  Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is it responsive to various screen sizes, and fast to load?
